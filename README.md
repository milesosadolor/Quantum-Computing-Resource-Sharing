# Decentralized Quantum Computing Resource Sharing (QuantumDAO)

A blockchain-based platform enabling decentralized sharing and allocation of quantum computing resources through smart contracts and distributed verification.

## Overview

QuantumDAO creates a decentralized marketplace for quantum computing resources, allowing quantum computer providers to share their resources and users to submit computational tasks. The platform ensures fair resource allocation, secure job execution, and verified results through blockchain technology.

## Core Components

### Quantum Computer Registration Contract

The Registration Contract manages quantum computing resources:

- Quantum computer registration and verification
- Resource capability profiling
- Qubit capacity tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Quantum coherence time tracking
- Hardware specifications management
- Maintenance schedule tracking
- Provider reputation system

### Job Submission Contract

The Job Submission Contract processes quantum computing requests:

- Task specification formatting
- Quantum circuit validation
- Resource requirement calculation
- Priority queue management
- Cost estimation
- Job scheduling
- Error handling protocols
- Result delivery management

### Resource Allocation Contract

The Resource Allocation Contract optimizes task distribution:

- Dynamic resource scheduling
- Load balancing algorithms
- Priority-based allocation
- Cost optimization
- Queue management
- Real-time availability tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Fault tolerance handling

### Result Verification Contract

The Result Verification Contract ensures computation accuracy:

- Result validation protocols
- Error detection
- Computation proof verification
- Classical verification methods
- Result consistency checking
- Performance metrics tracking
- Dispute resolution
- Quality assurance protocols

## Getting Started

```

### Submitting a Quantum Job

```javascript
const jobSubmission = await JobSubmissionContract.deploy();
await jobSubmission.submitJob(
    quantumCircuit,
    requirements,
    priority,
    timeConstraints
);
```

### Verifying Results

```javascript
const resultVerification = await ResultVerificationContract.deploy();
await resultVerification.verifyResults(
    jobId,
    results,
    verificationData,
    proofs
);
```
